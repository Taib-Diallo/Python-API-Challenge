## After each pair of plots, explain what the linear regression is modeling. 
For example, describe any relationships that you notice and any other findings you may have.

1. Temperature North and South - 
	### These 2 linear regression plots are modeling how temperature differs between the northern and southern hemisphers. 
	The northern hemisphere is negative trend while the southern hemisphere is showing a positive correlation. These graphs makes 
	sense because as you go from the equater (0) to the top of the earth (80), the temperature will drop. When you leave the south 
	pole (-50) and go towards the equater (0), the temperature will increase. 
2. Humidity North and South -
	### These two graphs show that humidity in the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere are similar with north having -0.07 and south 
	having 0.01 as coefficents. This could be due to the fact that both hemisphere graphs contain the eqauter.
3.Cloudiness North and South -
	### Both of these graphs have data points all over the graph. Therefore, none of these graphs have a clear overall trend. 
	This could be due to the fact that everywhere in the world has cloudy days regradless of the latitude. 
4. Wind Speed North and South -
	### The wind speed in both of these graphs show that there is no overall trend. 
	This could be due to the fact that regardless of the latitude wind is presnt in all parts if the world.
